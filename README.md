How do we deal with organic waste?
we will learn about what organic waste is 

Organic waste is a type of waste that comes from natural materials that can be biodegraded by microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. Examples of organic waste include food waste, fruit and vegetable peels, dry leaves and twigs
What is the importance of organic waste 

Organic waste is important because it has several significant benefits for the environment and daily life:

Recycling and Compost: Organic waste can be processed into compost, which functions as a natural fertilizer. This increases soil fertility and reduces the need for chemical fertilizers.

Waste Volume Reduction: Separating organic waste from inorganic waste reduces the volume of waste sent to landfills
